In the above links, I found a lot of resources surrounding lift and aerodynamics. My plan would be to begin with lift and stall points. How fast can I go before I hit the stall point, what lift will I have right before the stall point, how many angles can I reach before stalling, etc? There is already a predetermined equation that can calculate this but it is more of a trial and error so the plan would be to input the values, have the Neural net run through them, and then output the stall point. For this instance, I will be using a cessna172 to be able to find a lift coefficient without major trial and error.
